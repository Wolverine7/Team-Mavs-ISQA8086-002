* Role & responsibilities: Program Director at Hurricane Island Foundation.

* Job experience: 
          <br> Marine Science Instructor, Lead Aquarist, Assistant Program Director at Catalina Island Marine Institute (Jan 2005 - May 2009)
          <br> Marine Education Associate at Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (September 2011 - September 2012)
          <br> Research Associate at University of Maine (September 2012 - February 2014)
          <br> Program Director at Hurricane Island Foundation (March 2015 - Present)

* Education level & background: Phoebe originally hails from Punxsutawney, PA, Home of the Groundhog! She received a BA in Biology from Boston University in 2003. She lived her love for the ocean and education for 5 years as a marine science instructor, aquarist and Assistant Program Director for the Catalina Island Marine Institute in southern California. She then returned to Maine to pursue her love of science and complete her Dual Masters in Marine Science and Marine Policy at the University of Maine in 2012. She was a Marine Education Associate for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence - Ocean Systems (COSEE-OS) and a Research Associate for the lab of Dr. Richard Wahle, both at UMaine. She's glad to be working with HICSL to provide unique opportunities for experiential science education and leadership
          

* Interests & focus: She has a keen interest in Marine Science and also has a history of working with non-profit organization management. She is skilled in Science Communication, Management, Research, Education and Collaborative work. 

### 2. Organizational

#### Hurricane Island Foundation

* Sector (nonprofit, governmental, etc.): The Hurricane Island Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 2009.

* Mission: Their mission is to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, environmentally-sustainable island community.

* Stakeholders (who/what they serve/support): Researchers, Students, Volunteers, Business Partners

* Strengths & weaknesses: They are environmental friendly because of its remote location, Hurricane Island is completely off the grid. They make every effort to be carbon neutral and environmentally sensitive in the operations and activities of the island community. Solar arrays generate power used throughout the island. All toilets are waterless composting types, including high-tech Clivus systems. Waste greywater is treated entirely in our constructed wetlands. They grow some food on island and have plans for a greenhouse, expanded vegetable gardens, and a chicken coop. All elements of community life on the island are used for education and demonstration for program participants and Island visitors and are the focus of specific sustainable living courses.
     <br> Weakness - Resource Management is a challenge for them. They need more business partners to help them reach their goals.

* Culture: They follow Clan Culture. This working environment is a friendly one. People have a lot in common, and itâ€™s similar to a large family. The leaders or the executives are seen as mentors who are trying to share their research and educate more and more people about it. The organization is held together by loyalty and tradition.

### 3. Both individual & organizational

* Data capabilities (maturity/literacy):
The data was collected from the small closed area in the muscle ridge to observe and understand what can small closure accomplish for the Scallop's growth rate. The data that was presented to us consist of different spats data and each was tagged with defferent colors to distinguish them. In addition, each entry consist of temperature data. Temperature data provides another useful information to use during the research. 

* Requirements/needs:There are several requirements organization is looking for, due to the broad research interests. One of the requirement we are looking is scallop growth and the collaboration of different equipment in this process.For instance, the type of environment used to raise baby scallops, analyze the areas where the scallops are present and how the scallops are cultivated in those area, which gear type can be used, the effect of temperature on the demographic. There are many factors which needs to be taken care for scallop growth like temperature, location, closure zone, density and these factors are useful for analyzing the scallop growth and demographic. 


* Priorities: The main goal of this research is to find out how the small closure can effect the growth and population of the Scallop's in the given area. As the participants of aqua cultural research their objective is to understand the impact of different gear types on the growth rate of scallops. 

* Opportunities
Using these data and analysis, Local Fishermen can build a predictive model that will help to understand the demography and prepare for the changes.
