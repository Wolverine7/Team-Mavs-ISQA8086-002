### 2. Organizational

#### Hurricane Island Foundation

* Sector (nonprofit, governmental, etc.): The Hurricane Island Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 2009.

* Mission: Their mission is to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, environmentally-sustainable island community.

* Stakeholders (who/what they serve/support): Researchers, Students, Volunteers, Business Partners

* Strengths & weaknesses: They are environmental friendly because of its remote location, Hurricane Island is completely off the grid. They make every effort to be carbon neutral and environmentally sensitive in the operations and activities of the island community. Solar arrays generate power used throughout the island. All toilets are waterless composting types, including high-tech Clivus systems. Waste greywater is treated entirely in our constructed wetlands. They grow some food on island and have plans for a greenhouse, expanded vegetable gardens, and a chicken coop. All elements of community life on the island are used for education and demonstration for program participants and Island visitors and are the focus of specific sustainable living courses.
     <br> Weakness - Resource Management is a challenge for them. They need more business partners to help them reach their goals.

* Culture: They follow Clan Culture. This working environment is a friendly one. People have a lot in common, and it’s similar to a large family. The leaders or the executives are seen as mentors who are trying to share their research and educate more and more people about it. The organization is held together by loyalty and tradition.

### 3. Both individual & organizational

* Data capabilities (maturity/literacy):
The data was collected from the small closed area in the muscle ridge to observe and understand what can small closure accomplish for the Scallop's growth rate. The data that was presented to us consist of different spats data and each was tagged with defferent colors to distinguish them. In addition, each entry consist of temperature data. Temperature data provides another useful information to use during the research. 

* Requirements/needs:


* Priorities: The main goal of this research is to find out how the small closure can effect the growth and population of the Scallop's in the given area. As the participants of aqua cultural research their objective is to understand the impact of different gear types on the growth rate of scallops. 

* Opportunities
Using these data and analysis, Local Fishermen can build a predictive model that will help to understand the demography and prepare for the changes.
