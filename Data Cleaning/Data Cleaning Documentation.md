 ## Data description
The Data Displyed here is about the Scallop Growth in Hurricane Island. 
There are three important dataset we got from the client with the help of which we are doing the analysis of scallop growth. The dataset we have are Spat bag, Scallop growth and Temperature data.
The details of these basic dataset are as follows:
*	Spat bags Data: Spat is basically the small baby scallop which is recruit to an area. This is a planktonic stage for scallop which helps us understand what population dynamics are in an area, it also gives us an idea of recruitments to that area. Spat data are from north of the closures, south of the closures and within the closure.  The data are from the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Based on data present with us the average height of cage 1 scallop in oct 2017 was 24.87 and cage 2 was 43.7333. This was Random Sampled Measurements of 20 Individual scallops taken randomly. Also, the annual average growth(mm) of the scallops for the years 2016-2017 is approximately 20.86, with this data we can check for further variation over the following years. 
This data will help us understand which area is good for settlement around the closed area. Spat data is also gathered from ocean point area which is another closed area, but a larger closed area for long term which has been managed by Department of Rain fishery.
*	Scallop growth data: Scallop growth data is about growing scallops which are involved in aquaculture research. This data set is used to understand the impact of different gear types on the growth rate of scallops. Scallops has been put in different type of gear and cages and the size of scallops are measured every year, month and some time by weekly. By doing this measurement we can understand the impact of density and gear type on scallop growth.
All the scallops are tagged, to differentiate them from one another which also helps to follow their growth as an individual throughout their lifetime in the cages where scallops are grown. The decisions can be taken based on the growth rate analysis.
*	Temperature Data: Temperature data are some from spat bags which were deployed, and some are from gear and cages which is deployed in Hurricane Island. The variables present in temperature data help us understand spat, population dynamic, popular influences on growth rate of scallops. Also, the temperature of water can be obtained from the temperature data.
