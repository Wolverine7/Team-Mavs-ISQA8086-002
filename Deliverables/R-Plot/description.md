In the current research data, we tried to analyze the growth and the size of each scallop in the different closures.  For our sample, we got the total Scallop Counts across 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 year. According, to the result we gathered, and the calculation provided, the total counts of Scallops actually decreased from 2015 onwards. The first graph shows that the Scallop distribution across the years. We decided to use bar chart to represent scallop growth divided by years.
In the second data sample, we took the counts of total scallops across different closure zones. Based on the analysis, we noticed that the distribution was not even. First closure has far more total scallops counts compare to the south and the north. As far the graph we decided to show bar chart dividing scallops based on the zones.
