We have addressed the main research questions.

1) Find the mean of Scallops in each region based on the year 
2) Find the stadard deviation of scallop size which will be used for scallop growth analysis 
3) Query: Group by the closure and outputs the mean, by doing some we can find out with closure had better perfomance 
4) Missing data for 2017 SpatData were deleted, because they were not usefull for the analysis
