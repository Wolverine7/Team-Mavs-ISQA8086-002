## Steps for R Script Data

1. Open and Save each spat bag data to the csv
2. Move to the working directory for R Studio
3. Calculate, the mean, standard deviation, and the total count of Scallops. These calculation will later be used to estimate the growth of scallops and their size for each closure
4. Imported years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017
5. Split data
6. Missing data for 2017 SpatData were deleted, because they were not usefull for the analysis
7. Dead date was emited because the purpose of this research analysis is to find out the positive outcome
8. Query: Group by the closure and outputs the mean, by doing some we can find out with closure had better perfomance
